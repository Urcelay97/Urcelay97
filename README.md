- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicolas Urcelay @Urcelay97, here I put all my personal and university projects that I did. I'm in process to upload all my projects.

- 👀 I’m interested in programing **physical simulations**, **data science**, **machine learning** and **image procesing**.
- 🏁 Currently I work in a **julia** package named *DiferentialEvolution.jl* that implement **Diferential Evolution** in order to obtain critical values of a function.
- 🧑‍🎓 I studied physical engineering. Some of the courses that I took were:
  - Functional programing 
  - Data science
  - Machine learning
  - Numerical methods
  - Statistics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ language and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in some project that involves any of this topics: *image procesing*, *data science*, *machine learning*, *physics simulation*.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me a mail to nico_mx4@hotmail.com
